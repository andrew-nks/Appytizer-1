# Project Overview
Problem Statement:
In today's 21st century issues, we realise that many people are indecisive when it comes to choosing what to have for their meals. Such indecisiveness often occurs whether we are eating alone or with our friends &/or family. Eating with others can even lead to arguments and disputes, which can sour relationships. For those who wants to eay healthily, it is not convenient to search for food places that offer healthier options as there are not many. Also, some may have an inkling of what they would like to have but do not know which restaurants sell them. This ends up wasting a lot of time trying to search for such places.

To solve this:
Introducing Appytizer, which allows users to have food items reccommended for them based on the live weather. This would at least help users to have an idea of food suggestions they may crave. Also, our suggested recipes require users to input its calories, this greatly helps many sieve out food choices. Additionally, we implemented a search function that allows users to search for marketplaces or restaurants around the area based on the food item they feel like having.

# Implementation
